# ShopLite Load Tests — Locust

Performance test for the **ShopLite** e-commerce API, implemented with **Locust**.
It mirrors the same user journey as the [JMeter version](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests):
**Browse catalog → Add to cart (N items) → Checkout**, against placeholder endpoints
served by a tiny local mock backend.

This repo is part of a small series implementing the *same* scenario in different tools
(JMeter, k6, Locust, Gatling) so they can be compared directly.

## Contents
- `locust/locustfile.py` — the test: one `HttpUser` with the 3-step journey, named transactions
- `mock/` — dependency-free mock backend for the 3 placeholder endpoints
- `docker-compose.yml` — one-command demo (mock → Locust headless → HTML report)
- `docs/Proposed_Test_Approach.md` — performance testing strategy (SLIs/SLOs, cadence, Agile fit)
- `docs/Project_Brief.md` — anonymized project brief / context

## Run everything in Docker (one command)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Locust runs **headless** (10 users, 60s), waits for the mock to be healthy, and writes
`report.html` + CSV stats to `results/`. Open `results/report.html` when it finishes.

## The test
Named transactions (so they group in the report):
- **TX_Browse_Catalog** — `GET /api/catalog`
- **TX_Add_To_Cart** — `POST /api/cart/items` ×`CART_SIZE`, correlates `cartId`
- **TX_Checkout_PlaceOrder** — `POST /api/orders` with unique guest data

`catch_response` is used to validate status codes (200 / 201) and mark mismatches as failures —
preventing "fast but wrong" results.

### Tunable
- Load: edit `--users` / `--spawn-rate` / `--run-time` in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Cart size: `CART_SIZE` env var (default 10).
- Interactive UI instead of headless (needs a local Locust):
  ```bash
  locust -f locust/locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8080
  # then open http://localhost:8089
  ```

## Notes
- Endpoints are placeholders; the mock returns the minimal contract (`cartId`/`orderId`) so the journey runs green.
- The mock's latencies are illustrative only — this demonstrates the tooling and reporting, not real system performance.
- `--exit-code-on-error 1` makes the container exit non-zero if any request fails (CI-friendly).

## One scenario, five tools

The same ShopLite journey (browse → add-to-cart → checkout) is implemented across five
load-testing tools — each as a one-command Dockerized demo with an HTML report:

| Tool | Language / DSL | SLOs as | Report | Repo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apache JMeter | XML + Groovy | Assertions | HTML dashboard | [ShopLite-load-tests](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests) |
| Grafana k6 | JavaScript | Thresholds | HTML report | [ShopLite-load-tests-k6](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests-k6) |
| Locust | Python | Code-level checks | Built-in HTML | [ShopLite-load-tests-locust](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests-locust) |
| Gatling | Scala DSL | Assertions | HTML charts | [ShopLite-load-tests-gatling-scala](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests-gatling-scala) |
| Gatling | Java DSL | Assertions | HTML charts | [ShopLite-load-tests-gatling-javaDSL](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests-gatling-javaDSL) |
